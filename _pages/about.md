My name is Daniel, I study Data Science at ITAM, Mexico City. Throughout my studies I have learnt a variety of programing languages, including Python, Java and Prolog. I am well versed in many Python libraries including Pandas and Numpy.
I am able to run queries in both SQL and Mongo, and I am still learning some other skills.

Other interests of mine include reading - be it fantasy novels, comic books or history, watching movies, and playing video games. I also like learning about math and probability. In this page I will share some of the things I like about mostly related to Data Science!
