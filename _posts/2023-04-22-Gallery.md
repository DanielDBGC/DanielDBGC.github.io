I want to show a image as a way to try and understand how images in posts work. First, a single image:


{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/20230416_153833.jpg" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Cassandra Cain" %}

Now, a gallery:

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with **Markdown support**." %}
