I want to show a image as a way to try and understand how images in posts work.


{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/20230416_153833.jpg" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="This is a figure caption." %}

This is some text after the gallery just to make sure that everything aligns properly.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="This is a figure caption." %}
