This is my first post in the Github page, I am still learning how to use the template I chose but I think is looking pretty good, I will add a couple more post in the near future, mostly related to data science.


I am going to try the data snippets feature:

```python
def helloThere():
  print('General Kenobi!')
helloThere()
```
